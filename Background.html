        <h2>Our Story</h2>
        <p>-	Jay’s Slamming Burgers was started to give the Columbia, SC downtown area another valid option at cheeseburgers. We knew when we started this restaurant that we had some solid competition in and around this area, but we came in and put our nose down and went to work. Our restaurant was started by Jay Gordon and family, who grew up around Columbia, SC and saw an opportunity that he couldn’t miss knowing his love for cheeseburgers. Our purpose is to offer an assortment of toppings that you can choose from our menu or build your own burger. Toppings include but are not limited to pickles, pineapples, eggs, bacon, lettuce, onions, cheese, mustard, mayo, ketchup, fried mac and cheese, and almost anything you could think of. One of our specialty burgers is a donut burger that uses donuts instead of a bun for the burger. That’s what we want to bring to this area a wide variety of options to make you come back for more. </p>
